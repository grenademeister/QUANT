# AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA - pure NumPy/Pandas Implementation

This project provides a pure NumPy and Pandas implementation of classical time series models:
- **AR (AutoRegressive)**
- **MA (Moving Average)**
- **ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average)**
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**

The models are implemented from scratch to enhance understanding of time series dynamics and optimization without relying on external ML libraries.
